Here is the diagnostic tool for BMVC 2021 submission # 265 "Diagnosing Errors in Video Relation Detectors".

We provide a tiny ground truth file `demo_gt.json`, and tiny video relation detection results (under `demo_det/`) for the demo. 

Run `vrd_analysis.py` will get false positive analysis figure, false negative analysis figure, mAP gain analysis and relation characteristics analysis figures. These figures are saved as PDF files corresponding.

Please note that this is not the final version. We are continuing to make this diagnostic tool easier to use.
